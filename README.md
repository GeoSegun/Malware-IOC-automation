# Malware-IOC-automation
This automation is entirely written in python. The aim of this project is to automate file hashes into different hashes(sha-1, sha-256, MD-5) and also determination of malicious IOCs using Virus total api to check for malicious IOCS (IP,hashes,domains,etc). The script retuns a new dataframe in form of a csv file containing malicious Iocs.



Note: To use this code you would need to edit some paramters to meet how your data is structured.
